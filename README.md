# Personality-Prediction

Personality prediction has always been useful since the very beginning. These systems have been used in E-commerce sites, in competitive exams, psychometric tests, matrimonial sites, Government sectors like Army, Navy, Air Force. In this project, we discuss how the personality is identified using different ML clustering algorithms. The personality is automatically classified by the system after the user attempts the quiz using the data set provided in the back end. At the end when the results are displayed, a graph is shown which depicts the percentage of the OCEAN personality along with some insights on how the overall personality is. With the help of the current trending domain i.e., Machine Learning we designed a personality prediction system. Through this project we aimed at helping individuals who want to get to know more about themselves.
